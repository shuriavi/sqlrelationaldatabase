# Overview

I was able to work more with SQLite and figure out how to use sql inside of my code. In my code I show the different job sectors 
and average wage hourly as well as annually. In my program I make a database, use update, deletes, and queries to search for information. 
I wrote this software as a way to query and summarize data.

# Relational Database

I am using SQLite in python.

In my database jobs, I have one table called jobs with information about job sector, how many people are employed in that sector,
number of people employed per 1000 jobs, mean hourly wage, median hourly wage, and mean annual salary.

# Development Environment

I used SQLite and well as pythin in visual studio code.
